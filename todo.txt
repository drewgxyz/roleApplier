Tie in with some LLM like 3.5 to support:
    Parsing a pasted JD and turning into supported format script recongises


Somewhere to dump raw pasted JD in (ctrl+c and v of entire webpage into a box)

Auto output PDF file to useful directory

Add additional context to the projects on the bulletpoints, so LLM can fill in gaps with relevant technologies
    Include overall project what it did etc, more context the better
Add supported my own technologies, and ones to exclude like Rust etc


Way later
